Red Groups Color Vision Program 

## Description
# v0.2

The test will have you enter y or n any other input is now invaild and now it shows how many points you have at the end of each test and they add up lik if you got 2 points for test one and get 2 more for test 2 it will say 4 points in total after test 2 making it easier to understand what you got wrong.

## Developer

Vernon Earwood

## Example

To run the program, give the following commands:

```
g++ --std=c++11 main.cpp -o cvp
./cvp
```

Here is an example of the program running:

```
Picture 1: Please look at Picture 1. Do you see green? (y/n) y. Do you see orange? y
```

## C++ Guide

### Variables and Data Types

We used many variables and used different things from the library like sting and char for different uses in the code like string use the words like color so we can string the words together and used char for the y/n answers pr single letter stuf.

### Input and Output

We used the outputs to ask the question and give the points to the user and inputs were used so the person taking the test to put in there answers.

### Decisions

 We used if, else, and else if to say if you get the question right you get a point and if you get it wrong then you miss a point and you after the point system you go to the next question.

### Iteration

 Iteration is used in this project by asking the reader if they wish to take the test again to see if the can get a differnet score on the test.

### File Input and Output

 The outputs of the files in the are to add more points into the file and tally them so the user can see there score after the test is over.
 ### Arrays/Vectors
The Array I added into the code is for storing the colors in the code to make the code a lot cleaner and easier to read.

 ### Functions
The two functions I added to the code was a void and a bool function the void function is used to show what point you got for that picture though the points add up over time and the bool functions makes it so you can only input y or n or else you will get a message saying incorrect input.
