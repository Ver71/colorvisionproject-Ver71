## C++ Guide

### Variables and Data Types

We used many variables and used different things from the library like sting and char for different uses in the code like string use the words like color so we can string the words together and used char for the y/n answers pr single letter stuf.

### Input and Output

We used the outputs to ask the question and give the points to the user and inputs were used so the person taking the test to put in there answers.

### Decisions

!!!Replace with a summary and examples of how multiple decision constructs have been used effectively and appropriately!!! We used if, else, and else if to say if you get the question right you get a point and if you get it wrong then you miss a point and you after the point system you go to the next question.

### Iteration

 Iteration is used in this project by asking the reader if they wish to take the test again to see if the can get a differnet score on the test.

### File Input and Output

 The outputs of the files in the are to add more points into the file and tally them so the user can see there score after the test is over.
